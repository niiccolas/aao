# Plays-Playwrights ORM

In tonight's videos, we saw how to implement an ORM for the `plays` database. Your homework is to expand this ORM!

## Setup

Let's start with the code from the video lectures. Download the skeleton [here](http://assets.aaonline.io/fullstack/sql/homeworks/plays/skeleton.zip?raw=true).

Next, let's create our database. In SQLite, our databases are just files that store all our data. They are updated by executing SQL commands (creating/updating tables and rows). Our `import_db.sql` has all the code to create our tables and some seed data. We can create our database with the following command:

```bash
cat import_db.sql | sqlite3 plays.db
```

This will apply all the SQL commands in `import_db.sql` to `plays.db` from the `sqlite3` console. You should now see a `plays.db` file in your project directory. Let's get started.

## Enhancing Functionality

Let's add the following methods to our ORM:

- `Play::find_by_title(title)`
- `Play::find_by_playwright(name)` (returns all plays written by playwright)

In addition, create a Playwright class and add the following methods to our ORM.

- `Playwright::all`
- `Playwright::find_by_name(name)`
- `Playwright#new` (this is the initialize method)
- `Playwright#create`
- `Playwright#update`
- `Playwright#get_plays` (returns all plays written by playwright)

Remember, our `PlayDBConnection` class accesses the database stored in `plays.db`, which includes both the `plays` and `playwrights` tables.

## Testing your ORM

- Open up pry and load the plays.rb file

- Initialize an instance of the Playwright class by calling `Playwright#new` and passing it the necessary arguments.

  - Call `Playwright#create` on the instance that you just initialized. Then call `Playwright::all` to see that it was added to the database correctly.

- Similarly, test `Playwright#update`, and `Playwright#get_plays` by calling them on instances of the Playwright class.
