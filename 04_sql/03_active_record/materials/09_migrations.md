# Migrations

## Overview

We've discussed SQL databases, so we know that programs can store and pull out data from them. Data fetched from the DB can then be used to populate the attributes of Ruby objects.

As a program is written, the structure of the database will evolve. We would like some way to track the evolution of the database schema, so that this is tracked along with our code in our git repository.

Additionally, because we develop our app on our own machine, with our own local development database, but later deploy our application to a server running a production database, we need a way to record the transformations we've made locally, so that they may be "played back" and performed on the server database when we deploy our code.

Database *migrations* are a solution to these problems. A migration is a file containing Ruby code that describes a set of changes applied to the database. It may create or drop tables; it may add or remove columns from a table. Each new set of changes is written inside a new migration file, which is checked into the repository. ActiveRecord will take responsibility for performing the necessary migrations when you ask it.

In this chapter, we will teach you

- How to generate a migration,
- The common methods that you will use when writing migrations,
- How to perform migrations,
- How migrations relate to `schema.rb`

## Basics

Let's show a first migration. A migration is a Ruby class that extends `ActiveRecord::Migration`. The parent class takes care of the behind-the-scenes work. We are responsible only for describing our change in the `up/down` methods.

```ruby
class CreateProducts < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.1]
  def up
    create_table :products do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.text :description

      t.timestamps
    end
  end

  def down
    drop_table :products
  end
end
```

This migration adds a table called `products` with a string column called `name ` (this will mean a `VARCHAR(255)`; the length can be specified as an option) and a `TEXT` column called `description`. A primary key column called `id` will also be added; this is the default, we do not need to explicitly specify it. The timestamp columns `created_at` and `updated_at` which Active Record populates automatically will also be added because of `t.timestamps` (more later!).

We also define how to undo the migration in `down`: we drop the table. We'll talk about why you might want to roll back a migration later.

### Using the `change` method

It is often unnecessary to write the `down` method; the opposite of adding a column is always to drop the column; the opposite of creating a table is to drop the table.

Rails 5.1 makes migrations smarter by providing a `change` method. This method is preferred for writing constructive migrations (i.e. when adding columns or tables). The migration knows how to migrate your database and reverse it when the migration is rolled back without the need to write a separate `down` method.

```ruby
class CreateProducts < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.1]
  def change
    create_table :products do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.text :description

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

The default `up` and `down` methods will use the `change` method to know what to do (`up` will run the `change` code; `down` will reverse it).

This won't help for migrations which remove a column:

```ruby
class CreateProducts < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.1]
  def change
    remove_column :products, :description
  end
end
```

We can still run `up`, but running `down`, the migration won't know how to add back the `description` column; it hasn't recorded the type of this column, so it doesn't know what kind of column to restore. If you try to roll back this migration, ActiveRecord will yell at you.

## Generating migrations

To create a new migration named `AddPartNumberToProducts` you run the command:

```bash
$ rails generate migration AddPartNumberToProducts
```

This will create an empty but appropriately named migration:

```ruby
class AddPartNumberToProducts < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.1]
  def change
  end
end
```

Migrations are stored as files in the `db/migrate` directory, one for each migration class. The name of the file is of the form `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_create_products.rb`: the first part is a UTC timestamp followed by an underscore followed by the name of the migration. The name of the migration class (CamelCased version) should match the latter part of the file name; otherwise ActiveRecord will be confused. For example `20080906120000_create_products.rb` should define class `CreateProducts` and `20080906120001_add_details_to_products.rb` should define `AddDetailsToProducts`.

Now that we've created our migration, we will be able to edit it and add code that actually performs the actions we desire.

## Writing a migration

Inside your `up/down` or `change` methods, you may call methods of the parent class `ActiveRecord::Migration[5.1]`. Here we go through some of the most common.

### Creating tables

The migration method `create_table` will be one of your workhorses. A typical use would be:

```ruby
create_table :products do |t|
  t.string :name
  t.float :price

  t.timestamps
end
```

which creates a `products` table with columns called `name` and `price`. It will also add the `id` column (as discussed above) and also timestamps.

The object yielded to the block allows you to create columns on the table. The migration calls a method like `string` or `integer` on the table to create a column of that type. You then pass a symbol which supplies the name. In general, the format is

```
t.data_type :column_name, { option1: :option_value, option2: :option_value }
```

Supported column types include:

- `:boolean`
- `:date`
- `:datetime`
- `:float`
- `:integer`
- `:string`
- `:text`
- `:time`

### Changing tables

After you create a table, you may wish to modify it. Here are some of the most common methods:

- `add_column :table_name, :column_name, :type, options_hash`

- `remove_column :table_name, :column_name`

- `rename_column :table_name, :old_column_name, :new_column_name`

- `rename_table :old_table_name, :new_table_name`

- `add_index :table_name, [:column1, :column2], options_hash`

- `change_column :table_name, :column_name, :type, options_hash`; you can:
  1. Change the data type of a column
  2. Add the option `null: false` to add a `NOT NULL` constraint
  3. Add the option `default: value` to specify a default value

For example, to add `user_id` to the `applications` table:

```ruby
def change
  add_column :applications, :user_id, :integer
end
```

ActiveRecord will be able to reverse many of these commands. If in a migration you only use reversable commands, you need only write a change method. However, if you use `remove_column` or `change_column`, ActiveRecord will not be sure how to reverse this without your help; you need to write `up` and `down` in these cases.

### Timestamps

Active Record provides some shortcuts for common functionality. It is for example very common to add both the `created_at` and `updated_at` columns and so there is a method that does exactly that:

```ruby
create_table :products do |t|
  t.timestamps
end
```

The `created_at` and `updated_at` column will be automagically populated when you create a record; later, each time you update the row, Rails will update the `updated_at` attribute, too. This can help you keep track of the evolution of your data when trying to debug problems later.

I always add `timestamps` columns; they may well be useful later, and it would be premature optimization to remove them until necessary.

## Running migrations

To actually perform the migrations you have written but not yet run, use the command `rails db:migrate`. This will look in the `db/migrate` directory, find all unexecuted migrations, and run their `up` or `change` methods in order of creation time. Only when you run the rails task is the database actually modified.

### What migrations are run?

How does Rails know what migrations to run? It runs all "pending" migrations: migrations files in `db/migrate` that have not been previously run. Which migrations have been run are tracked in the database. ActiveRecord creates a table, `schema_migrations`, which stores the timestamp of each run migration. When a migration is run, a row with the migration timestamp is added to `schema_migrations`. Rails will not run any migration whose timestamp is in `schema_migrations`.

### Don't edit old migrations

Occasionally you will make a mistake when writing a migration. If you have already run the migration then you cannot just edit the migration and run the migration again: Rails will think it has already run the migration and so will do nothing when you run `rails db:migrate`. That's because the timestamp is in `schema_migrations`.

If you did need to change a migration you might be tempted to try and edit your old migration in an attempt to make your table look ideal. However, **editing old migrations should be avoided under any circumstance**. After you have written a migration and migrated it, treat that as a permanent part of the historical record of your schema's evolution.

Here's one reason why. Say you write a migration to create a `users` table; it contains `username` and `password` information. You push your code, run the migration and start running your web application.

A few weeks later, you decide that you want to add a new column. If you tried to edit the previous migration, you would have to first drop your database and then re-run the migrations. This would involve dropping the `users` table and all of its data. You could then edit and re-run, but your all data will be gone!

Even if you only push your code to development ("development" means the git branch that consists of recent code not yet deployed to the "production", user-facing application), you will frustrate other developers if you edit old migrations. Say I run your original `users` migration. You then edit it and push your code. When I fetch your code, running `rails db:migrate` will not run your changed migration. Instead, I have to myself reverse the **old** version of the migration (which I will have to recover; you checked in the edited version...), then re-run the new version.

The answer is simple in these cases: you should write a new migration that performs the changes you require. **Edit migrations by creating new migrations to change your table**.

## Bonus Round!

This information is not essential at this stage, but you should review it.

### The Schema File

Migrations, mighty as they may be, are not the authoritative source for your database schema. That role falls to `db/schema.rb`, which is essentially one big migration that ActiveRecord generates. Each time you run a migration, ActiveRecord will examine the resulting schema of the entire database, and dump this description into `db/schema.rb`. This file is not designed to be edited by humans, it just represents the current state of the database.

There is no need (and it is error prone) to initialize a new database by replaying the entire migration history. It is much simpler and faster to just load into the database a description of the current schema (`rails db:schema:load`). For this reason, the schema file should be checked into source control and tracked.

Schema files are also useful if you want a quick look at what attributes an Active Record object has. This information is not in the model's code and is frequently spread across several migrations, but the information is nicely summed up in the schema file. The [annotate_models](https://github.com/ctran/annotate_models) gem automatically adds and updates comments at the top of each model summarizing the schema if you desire that functionality.

You shouldn't worry too much about the `schema.rb` file for quite a while. Just do one thing: **check in the changes that result from running `rails db:migrate` whenever you write a new migration**. That will keep it from cluttering up your git status, and your repo will always have an up-to-date, authoritative description of the database schema.

I should note that I have seldom used `rails db:schema:load` to load the schema.

### Running arbitrary code

Migrations are not limited to changing the schema. We can run arbitrary code in our migration. This is helpful to fix bad data in the database or populate new fields.

```ruby
class AddReceiveNewsletterToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.1]
  def up
    change_table :users do |t|
      t.boolean :receive_newsletter, default: false
    end
    User.each do |user|
      # sign up existing users for the newsletter, though.
      user.receive_newsletter = true
      user.save!
    end
  end

  def down
    remove_column :users, :receive_newsletter
  end
end
```

This migration adds a `receive_newsletter` column to the `users` table. We want it to default to `false` for new users, but existing users are considered to have already opted in, so we use the User model to set the flag to `true` for existing users.
