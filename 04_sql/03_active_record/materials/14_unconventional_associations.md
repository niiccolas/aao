# Unconventional Associations

## Reflexive Associations

We've learned about the `class_name`/`foreign_key`/`primary_key` options for `belongs_to` and `has_many`. We know that Rails can often infer these. Let's see an example where it cannot:

```ruby
class Employee < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :subordinates,
    class_name: 'Employee',
    foreign_key: :manager_id,
    primary_key: :id

  belongs_to :manager,
    class_name: 'Employee',
    foreign_key: :manager_id,
    primary_key: :id
end
```

I call this a *reflexive association*, because the association refers back to the same table. Here, there is a `employees.manager_id` column that refers to `employees.id` column.

We have to use the non-standard association names `subordinates`/`manager` because `employees`/`employee` would be extremely confusing to understand. Also, Rails itself will probably get confused if you have two associations on the same class that differ only in pluralization.

Note that I also departed from the conventional `employee_id` column name. `manager_id` better explains the nature of this key.

## Two associations to the same class

Let's look at another example:

```ruby
# emails: id|from_email_address|to_email_address|text
#  users: id|email_address

class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many(
    :sent_emails,
    class_name: 'Email',
    foreign_key: :from_email_address,
    primary_key: :email_address
  )
  has_many(
    :received_emails,
    class_name: 'Email',
    foreign_key: :to_email_address,
    primary_key: :email_address
  )
end

class Email < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to(
    :sender,
    class_name: 'User',
    foreign_key: :from_email_address,
    primary_key: :email_address
  )
  belongs_to(
    :recipient,
    class_name: 'User',
    foreign_key: :to_email_address,
    primary_key: :email_address
  )
end
```

Here the `Email` and `User` objects are associated in two ways: sender and recipient. Additionally, the `Email` record doesn't reference `User`'s `id` field directly; instead, it refers to an `email_address`. For that reason, we need to specify the `primary_key` option; this is otherwise by default simply `id`.

Through these two examples, we've seen that we can go beyond the conventional `ActiveRecord` guesses in cases where our associations are a little special.
