# Associations II: `has_many :through`

## The Problem

We've defined two kinds of associations; `belongs_to` associates a record holding a foreign key to the record the key points to, while `has_many` associates a record with one or more entities that hold a foreign key pointing to it.

What about indirect relations? For instance, consider the following example:

```ruby
class Physician < ApplicationRecord
  has_many(
    :appointments,
    class_name: 'Appointment',
    foreign_key: :physician_id,
    primary_key: :id
  )
end

class Appointment < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to(
    :physician,
    class_name: 'Physician',
    foreign_key: :physician_id,
    primary_key: :id
  )

  belongs_to(
    :patient,
    class_name: 'Patient',
    foreign_key: :patient_id,
    primary_key: :id
  )
end

class Patient < ApplicationRecord
  has_many(
    :appointments
    class_name: 'Appointment',
    foreign_key: :patient_id,
    primary_key: :id
  )
end
```

Here both a `Physician` and a `Patient` may have many appointments. What if we want to get all the `Patient`s who have an `Appointment` with a given `Physician`? One way to do this is to get the `Appointment`s for the `Physician`, then loop through these to get the `Patient` objects:

```ruby
patients = physician.appointments.map do |appointment|
  appointment.patient
end
```

Holy multiple lines of code, Batman. More importantly, note that each call of `appointment.patient` will fire another DB query; if a `Physician` has 100s of `Appointment`s, this will fire 100s of DB queries. Running 100s of queries will really, really slow down our app.

This is called an `N+1` query: we do one query for the first fetch of `appointments`, and then `N` queries for `patient`, one for each of `N` appointments. As a `Physician` gains more `Appointment`s, this will grow slower and slower.

There has to be a better way.

## The solution: `has_many :through`

We can use a new kind of association, `has_many :through` that links up two existing associations. **Important note: a `has_many :through` association has nothing to do with the traditional `has_many`**.

```ruby
class Physician < ApplicationRecord
  has_many(
    :appointments,
    class_name: 'Appointment',
    foreign_key: :physician_id,
    primary_key: :id
  )

  has_many :patients, through: :appointments, source: :patient
end

class Appointment < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to(
    :physician,
    class_name: 'Physician',
    foreign_key: :physician_id,
    primary_key: :id
  )

  belongs_to(
    :patient,
    class_name: 'Patient',
    foreign_key: :patient_id,
    primary_key: :id
  )
end

class Patient < ApplicationRecord
  has_many(
    :appointments
    class_name: 'Appointment',
    foreign_key: :patient_id,
    primary_key: :id
  )

  has_many :physicians, through: :appointments, source: :physician
end
```

A `has_many :through` association associates records *through* other tables. The most typical case is the one we have here: where two models are related in a many-to-many way through an intermediary **join table**. In this case, `Physician` and `Patient` are associated through an intermediary `appointments` table.

Let's pull apart the `has_many :through` association. Take the example of:

```ruby
has_many :patients, through: :appointments, source: :patient
```

The critical thing here is to note that `:through` and `:source` name **other associations**. `has_many :through` links existing associations. First define these underlying associations and then you can stitch them up using `has_many :through`.

A `has many :through` association can be thought of as a two step process. Step one is to travel through the `:through` association on the model; in this case, `Physician#appointments`. Note that it is necessary to have defined an `appointments` association on `Physician`.

The next step is to continue on from the `Appointment` to `Patient`. It does this by using the `:source` association name; the second step is to follow the `Appointment#patient` association. Again, this association must be defined.

Let me stress this: **a `has_many :through`association simply names two existing associations and links them up**. First the `:through` association is traversed, then the `:source` association.

You **must not** specify low-level details like `:class_name`, `:foreign_key` and `:primary_key`: they are not relevant. `has_many :through` works at the level of associations, not tables.

`:source` is an unfortunate, unclear name. You can think of it as "step two" in your mind.

## The SQL and the Damage Done

Okay, how does `has_many :through` work? What SQL does it generate? As a refresher, let's consider `Physician#appointments` and `Appointment#patient`:

```ruby
physician.appointments
# SELECT
#   appointments.*
# FROM
#   appointments
# WHERE
#   appointments.physician_id = ?

appointment.patient
# SELECT
#  patients.*
# FROM
#  patients
# WHERE
#  patients.id = ?
```

Through a process that should seem magical to you right now, `has_many :through` will combine the two associations into a single query using a `JOIN`:

```ruby
physician.patients
# SELECT
#  patients.*
# FROM
#  appointments
# JOIN
#  patients ON appointments.patient_id = patients.id
# WHERE
#  appointments.physician_id = ?
```

Notice that we need a join here: we want to return patient information, but we also need appointment information to see if the patient is scheduled with the doctor.

Please also note that we needed all the underlying information of the constituent associations: we needed `class_name`/`foreign_key`/`primary_key` from each of the associations we are building the `has_many :through` from. However, note that we do not need additional information beyond this. That's why we don't need to specify these attributes with the `has_many :through`. It uses the attributes of the underlying associations which were already specified when defined those.

### More degrees of separation

In the examples above, the `:through` was a `has_many` association and the `:source` was a `belongs_to` association.

`has_many :through` doesn't care about the kind of associations though. We could go `:through` a `belongs_to` and onward with a `:source` of `has_many`. Or, another option is to combine two `has_many` associations.

We can link objects that are further separated by using a `has_many :through` association as the `:through` or `:source` (or both!). This will necessitate more `JOIN`s, but still be a single query.

The point is that `has_many :through` does not care about the kind of underlying associations. It is smart and knows how to build a query from any pair of constituent associations.
