# Self Joins

### What is a self join?

A self join is exactly what it sounds like: an instance of a table joining with itself. The way you should visualize a self join for a given table is by imagining a join performed between two identical copies of that table.

Let's take a look at a classic self-join example. This returns each employee's first and last name along with their manager's.

##### Employee Table

| id   | first_name | last_name | manager_id |
| :--- | :--------- | :-------- | :--------- |
| 1    | Kush       | Patel     | NULL       |
| 2    | Jeff       | Fiddler   | 1          |
| 3    | Quinn      | Leong     | 2          |
| 4    | Shamayel   | Daoud     | 2          |
| 5    | Robert     | Koeze     | 4          |
| 6    | Munyo      | Frey      | 3          |
| 7    | Kelly      | Chung     | 4          |

```sql
SELECT
  team_member.first_name, team_member.last_name,
   manager.first_name, manager.last_name
FROM
  employee AS team_member
JOIN
  employee AS manager ON manager.id = team_member.manager_id
```

| team_member.first_name | team_member.last_name | manager.first_name | manager.last_name |
| :--------------------- | :-------------------- | :----------------- | :---------------- |
| Jeff                   | Fiddler               | Kush               | Patel             |
| Quinn                  | Leong                 | Jeff               | Fiddler           |
| Shamayel               | Daoud                 | Jeff               | Fiddler           |
| Robert                 | Koeze                 | Shamayel           | Daoud             |
| Munyo                  | Frey                  | Quinn              | Leong             |
| Kelly                  | Chung                 | Shamayel           | Daoud             |

In all the examples you've covered thus far, JOINs were performed on two different tables (presumably with two different names), which made it easy to reference a specific column in a table. Since we only deal with one table in a self join, we have to use **aliases**.

An alias is essentially a nickname for a table (or, in some cases, a column). This is necessary because the query processor needs to make a distinction between the duplicates of the same table to JOIN them. Keep in mind, the keyword **AS** is not necessary to alias tables or columns. The above SQL query could be rewritten:

```sql
SELECT
  team_member.first_name, team_member.last_name,
   manager.first_name, manager.last_name
FROM
  employee team_member
JOIN
  employee manager ON manager.id = team_member.manager_id
```
