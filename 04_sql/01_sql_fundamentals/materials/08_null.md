## NULL and Ternary Logic in SQL

SQL uses **ternary logic**. This means that a conditional statement can evaluate to `TRUE`, `FALSE` or `NULL` (unknown). Whaaaa? :open_mouth: And somehow `NULL` is still 'falsy'? Unfortunately, this won't be the only time you run into logic that defies intuition. *Stay tuned for Javascript quirks.*

If we ask if a `NULL` value `== NULL`, we will always get false. This is because `NULL` was derived to represent an unknown value. How can we know if two unknowns are the same? We can't. Given that this sort of comparison doesn't yield any useful information, always use `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL` in place of the traditional (`==` or `!=`) comparisons.
