# Using Git `add`

Use `git add <files>` or `git add -A` instead of `git add .` or `git add -u`.

## The Background

When you run `git add .` you're telling git, "take everything that's new or has changed in my current directory and add it to the staging area". We discourage this, because we usually are only working on a few files at a time and it is easy to accidentally include files that have sensitive information (such as API Keys, etc.).

When you run `git add -A` you are telling git, "take my all the changes from my entire project up to my top level directory(where the .git directory resides) and add those to my staging area". We also discourage this, because we usually are only working on a few files at a time and it is easy to accidentally include changes that have nothing to do with the current commit.

What should I do instead?

*   You should be adding individual files as you create them and running `git add <file>`.
    *   This way you avoid adding any unwanted files and your commits are isolated.

NOTE: `-A` and `-u` are options of the `git add` command. They use the project directory if you don't explicitly give them a filepath, e.g. `git add -u lib/board`. For example, `.` is the filepath that you pass in as an argument to `git add`.

`git add -u` adds all new and updated files (but doesn't include deleted files!) - this command isn't as relevant when using Git 2.0\.
