# Practice Problem Tips

From this section on, you'll notice that the practice problems will be a bit more complex. You'll be asked to write a method to perform a specific task. Don't panic, there is a video walkthrough that follows every practice problem! If you are stuck on a problem, peek ahead to the next task (through the course outline) for some help. However, before you move on from studying a given problem, make sure you can write the code solution yourself. Here are some tips to solving these problems:

- Read the question thoroughly.
- Analyze the examples to ensure you understand how the method should behave.
- Think about what type of data the method is taking in as parameters and what type it should return.
- Test your code by calling the examples, be sure to print out the results so you can check them.

Good luck programmer!
