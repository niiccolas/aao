## Practice Problem Tasks

You'll get the most out of this course by writing code in the practice problems. In the practice problem tasks, you'll want to write your code at the top, and run the code at the bottom. There's also a tab containing the solution code:

## Final Tip

To become better programmers, we must program! You'll find many videos in this course that walk through concepts and problems, but don't fall into the trap of just watching the videos. Get practical. *Work on the practice problems. Before you move on from a given problem, make sure you can write and understand the solution.*

That's it. Let's learn to program!
