# CSS Syntax Exercise

- ⏱ 30 minutes

Download this [skeleton](http://assets.aaonline.io/fullstack/html-css/micro-projects/css_syntax/skeleton.zip). Add a new external stylesheet to the assets folder, and add a link tag for it in the html page. Open up the html page in your web browser and use the CSS workflow from Day 1 to begin styling the recipe page with some basic CSS syntax.

1. Select the body element and set the `font-family` property to "Arial, sans-serif"
2. Set the `font-size` to 38px for all H1 elements
3. Set the `font-size` to 32px for all H2 elements
4. Add a class to your unordered list of ingredients called "ingredients-list"
5. Add a `list-style` property with a value of "square inside" to all elements with the "ingredients-list" class
6. Add another `list-style` of your choosing to all ordered list elements
7. Change the width of the logo image to 100px by selecting all img elements that are immediate children of the header element

- **Hint:** Use `>`

1. Select all anchor elements within list elements within unordered list elements and remove their underlines. Also change their color to inherit.
2. Give your whole recipe page a nice `background-color`
3. Set the `line-height` to 1.5 in your css_reset file

**Challenge:** Come up with a way to select and style your reviews after they are submitted. For now just some simple font-styling is fine.

When you review the solution, carefully review the stylesheet and compare to your own.
