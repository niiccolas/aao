### Phase III: `Pieces`

There are many different kinds of pieces in chess, and each moves a specific way. Based on their moves, they can be placed in four categories:

1. Sliding pieces (Bishop/Rook/Queen)
2. Stepping pieces (Knight/King)
3. Null pieces (occupy the 'empty' spaces)
4. Pawns (we'll do this class last)

Start by writing a `Piece` parent class that contains the functionality common to all pieces. A key method of `Piece` is `#moves`, which should return an array of places a `Piece` can move to. Of course, every piece will move differently, so you can't write (**implement**) the `#moves` method of `Piece` without subclasses.

*NB* You will not implement tricky moves like "en passant". Don't implement castling, draws, or pawn promotion either. You **will** handle check and check mate, however.

You should make [modules](https://open.appacademy.io/learn/full-stack-online-ruby/modules) for `Slideable` and `Stepable`. Accessing this on GitHub? Use [this link](https://github.com/appacademy/curriculum/blob/master/ruby/readings/modules.md). The `Slideable` module can implement `#moves`, but it needs to know what directions a piece can move in (diagonal, horizontally/vertically, both). Classes that `include` the module `Slideable`(`Bishop`/`Rook`/`Queen`) will need to implement a method `#move_dirs`, which `#moves` will use.

Your `Piece` will need to (1) track its position and (2) hold a reference to the `Board`. Classes that `include Slideable` in particular need the `Board` so they know to stop sliding when blocked by another piece. Don't allow a piece to move into a square already occupied by the same color piece, or to move a sliding piece past a piece that blocks it.

The `NullPiece` class should include [the `singleton` module](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/singleton/rdoc/Singleton.html). It will not need a reference to the `Board` - in fact its `initialize` method should take no arguments. Make sure you have a way to read its `color` and `symbol`.

**After completing each piece** load the file in pry and make sure it moves properly. **Once you have completed all pieces** refactor your `Board#initialize` so that all your pieces are placed in their respective starting positions. Run `ruby display.rb` to check that they show up in the proper locations.

For now, do not worry if a move leaves a player in check.

## Phase IV: `Board#in_check?(color)` and `Board#checkmate?(color)`

The `Board` class should have a method `#in_check?(color)` that returns whether a player is in check. You can implement this by (1) finding the position of the King on the board then (2) seeing if any of the opposing pieces can move to that position.

Then write a `#checkmate?(color)` method. If the player is in check, and if none of the player's pieces have any `#valid_moves` (to be implemented in a moment), then the player is in checkmate.

*NB* Here's a four-move sequence to get to checkmate from a starting board for your checkmate testing:

- f2, f3
- e7, e5
- g2, g4
- d8, h4
